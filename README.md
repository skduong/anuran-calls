This project explores classifying frog families using sound data (MFCCs). It was done in both R and Python to explore the differences between the 2 languages.

The classification task of using frog sound data to identify which family they belong to could be useful in performing ecological surveys. Since many frog species are nocturnal, it could be easier to identify them through audio rather than visually.
