This project explores classifying frog families using sound data (MFCCs). It was done in both R and Python to explore the differences between the 2 languages. 

Motivations: <br />
The classification task of using frog sound data to identify which family they belong to could be useful in performing ecological surveys. Since many frog species are nocturnal, it could be easier to identify them through audio rather than visually.

Frogs are known to be important indicators of environmental health because their permeable skin makes them susceptible to toxins. They live on both land and water throughout their lives, so their presence gives an overview of an ecosystem's air, water, and soil quality. Identifying the family of frogs living within an area could indicate what substances are present or absent, depending on the family's sensitivity to certain pollutants.

In addition, detecting a foreign family of frogs could aid in environmental preservation. Frogs are generalist predators, feeding on a wide array of prey. This characteristic makes invasive frogs particularly damaging to the environment since they can alter the food supply and habitat of native species.
